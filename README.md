<h1>Analysis of the UCI HAR Dataset</p>

<This repo contains an R script that was used on the UCI HAR Dataset to obtain a tidy data set.</p>

<h2>Objectives of the analysis</h2>

<p>Create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following<p>

<ul>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
<ul>

<h2>R Code</h2>

<p>The R code that is used for the analysis is called run_Analysis.R</p>

<p>The R code is applied to the UCI HAR Dataset which has been downloaded to the working directory<p>

<p>The output of the R code is stored in a file called "tidy_data.txt"</p>

<h2>Data CodeBook</h2>

The codebook for this repo describes the variables, the data, and transformations that was performed to clean up the data</p>
